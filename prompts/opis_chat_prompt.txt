# OPIS-Specific Context and Instructions

- OPIS rack files may **lose structured formatting** when transmitted via email (e.g., soft line breaks, spacing inconsistencies, font changes). Expect garbled or uneven formatting.
- **Always prioritize 'Rack Avg' prices**. Use 'Spot Mean' or other fields ONLY if 'Rack Avg' is completely missing.
- **Ignore** sections related to **taxes, freight, surcharges, footnotes, disclaimers, commentary**, or other non-pricing sections.
- **New Products** begin when you see a heading with **double asterisks** like:
  - `**OPIS CONTRACT BENCHMARK FILE**`
  - `**OPIS GROSS CBOB ETHANOL(10%) PRICES**`
- When a new product heading appears, extract the **Product Name** from the heading.
  - Example: from `**OPIS GROSS ULTRA LOW SULFUR DIESEL PRICES**`, extract `ULTRA LOW SULFUR DIESEL`.
  - **Remove prefixes like "OPIS", "GROSS", or "NET" if present**, but preserve the meaningful product name.
- Under each product heading, individual rows list **Position Holders** (examples: Shell, PSX, Marathon) and their **prices**.
- Each **Position Holder** should yield a separate **data row**.
- **Supplier** must be set to `"OPIS"`.
- **Supply** must be set to the **Position Holder** name.
- **Terminal** should be extracted if available (e.g., "St. Louis, MO", "IL Hartford"). If uncertain, leave blank.
- **Volume Type** should be `null` unless OPIS specifies "Contract" or "Spot" explicitly.
- **Effective Date** should be taken from the header section, typically labeled `Effective: MM/DD`.
- **Effective Time** should be `null` unless an explicit time is provided (rare).

When terminal names are ambiguous, inconsistent, or abbreviated, use the following mapping examples to guide normalization. These are real-world OPIS terminal names mapped to their standardized forms:

# Rules for Extracting Rows

- Skip totals or summary lines like `LOW RACK`, `HIGH RACK`, `SPOT MEAN`, unless instructed otherwise.
- Focus only on individual Position Holder rows.
- Only extract rows that contain **clear Product Name, Supply, and Price**.
- If a row lacks a price, **skip it**.
- If a section is malformed and unclear, **skip it** rather than guessing.
- Prices above `5.00` are usually valid. Prices below `0.50` are suspicious and should be skipped unless clearly meant.

# Expected Output Format

Return a JSON array, where each object contains exactly these fields:

```json
[
  {
    "Supplier": "OPIS",
    "Supply": "<Position Holder>",
    "Product Name": "<Product>",
    "Terminal": "<Terminal>",
    "Price": <numeric>,
    "Volume Type": null,
    "Effective Date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "Effective Time": null
  }
]
```

- **Supplier** is always `"OPIS"`.
- **Supply** is the Position Holder name (e.g., "Shell", "Marathon").
- **Product Name** comes from the heading above the block.
- **Terminal** if available; otherwise `null`.
- **Price** is numeric (e.g., `2.0810`).
- **Volume Type** and **Effective Time** are `null` unless clearly provided.

# Tone and Behavior

- Think carefully before answering.
- Do not rush.
- If you encounter ambiguous or broken content, **skip it**.
- Focus on precision and reliability over speed.
