# OPIS-Specific Context and Instructions
- OPIS rack files may lose structured formatting when transmitted via email (e.g., soft line breaks, spacing inconsistencies, font changes). Expect garbled or uneven formatting.
- Always prioritize 'Rack Avg' prices. Use 'Spot Mean' or other fields ONLY if 'Rack Avg' is completely missing.
- Ignore sections related to taxes, freight, surcharges, footnotes, disclaimers, commentary, or other non-pricing sections.
- New Products begin when you see a heading with double asterisks like:
  - `OPIS CONTRACT BENCHMARK FILE`
  - `OPIS GROSS CBOB ETHANOL(10%) PRICES`
- When a new product heading appears, extract the Product Name from the heading.
  - Example: from `OPIS GROSS E-85 PRICE`, extract `E85`.
  - Remove prefixes like "OPIS", "GROSS", or "NET" and PRICE if present, but preserve the meaningful product name.
- Under each product heading, individual rows list Position Holders (examples: Shell, PSX, Marathon,Hartford) and their prices.
- Each Position Holder should yield a separate data row.

- Supplier is always `"OPIS"`.
- Supply is the Position Holder name (e.g., "Shell", "Marathon").
- Product Name comes from the heading above the block.
- Price is numeric (e.g., `2.0810` or `196.30`).
- Terminal should be extracted if available (e.g., "St. Louis, MO", "IL Hartford"). If uncertain, leave blank.
- Volume Type should be `"Contract"` if the file is labeled as such. Otherwise, use `null` unless OPIS specifies "Contract" or "Spot".
- Effective Date should be taken from the header section (e.g., `2025-05-06`) and formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- Effective Time should be `null` unless an explicit time is provided (rare).

# Terminal Extraction Guidance (Expanded)
OPIS rack pricing reports often use terminal codes to represent fuel terminal locations. These codes are structured with supplier or pipeline prefixes followed by the location name.

For example:
- "FH-MG-KANSAS CITY" indicates the **Magellan terminal in Kansas City**.
- "FH-CH-TULSA" refers to the **Chevron terminal in Tulsa**.
- "FH-MG-EL DORADO" represents the **Magellan terminal in El Dorado**.

Please extract the full terminal name from these codes, using known mappings where possible. If a mapping is not available, extract the most meaningful location or terminal name portion (e.g., ‚ÄúKANSAS CITY‚Äù, ‚ÄúTULSA‚Äù).

You may use the terminal prefix to assist with identifying the pipeline or supply network, but the main goal is to extract and standardize the terminal **location name**.

‚ö†Ô∏è Do NOT default to "St. Louis, MO" from the header.
- "St. Louis, MO" appears at the top of many reports and near each product header as the publisher location, not the terminal.
- Do not assume ‚ÄúSt. Louis, MO‚Äù is the terminal unless it appears within the actual product pricing section (e.g., ‚ÄúFOB ST. LOUIS‚Äù).

‚úÖ Treat a location as a terminal only when:
- It appears in or near a block of Position Holder prices.
- It is a clear heading like:
  - `HARTFORD IL TERMINAL`
  - `ST. LOUIS, MO TERMINAL`
  - `FOB ST. LOUIS` (appears in a row with a price)

üö´ Skip or leave blank if:
- The only appearance of "St. Louis, MO" is at the top of the file.
- There is no clear terminal heading near the price block.

## ‚úÖ Valid Examples

Valid Terminal Assignment:
FOB ST. LOUIS -- -- -- -- 240.14
Assign `"Terminal": "St. Louis, MO"`.

Invalid Terminal Assignment (Header only):
ST. LOUIS, MO                                          2025-05-05 10:00:54 EDT
                   **OPIS CONTRACT BENCHMARK FILE**                    
                    **OPIS GROSS RFG E-75 PRICES**                     

Leave `"Terminal": ""` ‚Äî this is not a terminal reference.

‚úÖ Example 1 ‚Äî Terminal Present

Raw:
OPIS GROSS ULTRA LOW SULFUR DIESEL PRICES

Hartford
SHELL 2.0810
MARATHON 2.0790

Output:
{
  "Supply": "Shell",
  "Product Name": "ULTRA LOW SULFUR DIESEL",
  "Terminal": "IL Hartford",
  ...
}
‚úÖ Example 2 ‚Äî Terminal Missing

Raw:
OPIS GROSS CBOB ETHANOL(10%) PRICES

SHELL                 2.1050  
MARATHON              2.1080

Output:
{
  "Supply": "Shell",
  "Product Name": "CBOB ETHANOL(10%)",
  "Terminal": "",
  ...
}

Terminal Normalization Examples
When terminal names are ambiguous, inconsistent, or abbreviated, use the following mapping examples to guide normalization.

Rules for Extracting Rows
Skip totals or summary lines like LOW RACK, HIGH RACK, SPOT MEAN, unless instructed otherwise.

Focus only on individual Position Holder rows.

Only extract rows that contain clear Product Name, Supply, and Price.

If a row lacks a price, skip it.

If a section is malformed and unclear, skip it rather than guessing.

Prices above 5.00 are usually valid. Prices below 0.50 are suspicious and should be skipped unless clearly meant.

Expected Output Format
Return a JSON array. Each object must contain exactly the following fields:
{
  "Supplier": "OPIS",
  "Supply": "<Position Holder>",
  "Product Name": "<Product>",
  "Terminal": "<Terminal>",
  "Price": <numeric>,
  "Volume Type": "Contract" | null,
  "Effective Date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "Effective Time": null
}
